    return "Thank you for joining the Leviathan News Livestream!\n\
\n\
Livestreams occur every weekday at 2:00 PM UTC (7 AM PT, 10 AM ET).  They usually run for 20 minutes, during which we provide running commentary about the last 24 hours of crypto news.  When a guest participates, we usually offer the guest 10 minutes of Q&A on their topic, after which they can leave or join us to chat about news.\n\
\n\
Scheduling is handled through our Calendly (which has only 15 minute slots because we don't want to pay Calendly): https://calendly.com/lnnheadlines/interview\n\
\n\
When joining, set your username to `@your_twitter_handle` if you use Twitter so people can more easily find you.  Also inform the hosts of any topics you prefer we do not discuss before we go live.\n\
\n\
We will send you a link to join the stream when it is ready\n\
\n\
To see past episodes, please check our prior streams at YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@Leviathan_News) or Spotify (https://open.spotify.com/show/69yxNKomUIbdNMFoTjp49K)\n\
\n\
Make sure to run the /ethereum command in a direct DM with the bot (@{settings.TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME}) for a good time!\n\
\n\
If you have other questions, please inquire in the Telegram channel: https://t.me/+zqRS5HW8GlgzY2Ix"
